# GAZE - Code Snippet Manager
## Complete Development Plan

### Project Overview
GAZE is a production-ready Rails 7.2 application that helps developers save, organize, search, and share code snippets effectively. It addresses the common developer pain point of losing track of useful code snippets across different projects and platforms.

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Models (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Database Design & Models
**Expected Outcome**: Solid data foundation with proper relationships

#### Models to Create:
- **User** (authentication & profiles)
  - Fields: email, password_digest, name, username, avatar, bio
  - Validations: unique email/username, password strength
  - Has many snippets, collections, tags

- **Snippet** (core entity)
  - Fields: title, description, code, language, visibility (public/private), user_id
  - Validations: presence of title, code, language
  - Belongs to user, has many tags through snippet_tags

- **Tag** (organization system)
  - Fields: name, color, user_id
  - Validations: unique name per user
  - Has many snippets through snippet_tags

- **SnippetTag** (join table)
  - Fields: snippet_id, tag_id

- **Collection** (snippet grouping)
  - Fields: name, description, visibility, user_id
  - Has many snippets, belongs to user

#### Database Features:
- Full-text search indexes on snippets (title, description, code)
- Composite indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints
- Database-level validations

### 1.2 Authentication System
**Expected Outcome**: Secure user authentication with Rails standards

- Rate limiting for authentication attempts

### 1.3 Basic Controllers & Routes
**Expected Outcome**: RESTful API structure with proper security

#### Controllers:
- `ApplicationController` (base security, current_user)

- `RegistrationsController` (signup)
- `PasswordResetsController` (forgot password)
- `SnippetsController` (CRUD operations)
- `TagsController` (CRUD operations)
- `CollectionsController` (CRUD operations)

#### Route Structure:
```ruby
# Authentication
get '/login', to: 'sessions#new'
post '/login', to: 'sessions#create'
delete '/logout', to: 'sessions#destroy'
get '/signup', to: 'registrations#new'
post '/signup', to: 'registrations#create'

# Main application
resources :snippets do
  member do
    patch :toggle_visibility
    get :raw
  end
  collection do
    get :search
    get :public
  end
end

resources :tags, except: [:show]
resources :collections do
  resources :snippets, only: [:index, :create, :destroy], controller: 'collection_snippets'
end

# User profiles
resources :users, only: [:show, :edit, :update], param: :username
```
